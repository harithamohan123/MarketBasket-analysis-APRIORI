# Market Basket Analysis Using APRIORI

In this project, we use APRIORI for identifying the buying pattern to increase sales - Association with items. 
Example : If a customer buy bread then find whether they will buy butter along with it. If a customer buy bread and butter will the customer buy ketchup along with it.

Procedure:                                                                                                                          
=> Analyse the problem that is need to be found, here we need to identify association or pattern behind item brought by customers.                         
=> Importing dataset of sales report.                                                                                                                             
=> Summarize dataset..                                                                                                  
=> Create rating matix of shape(m x u).                                                                                                  
=> Implement APRIORI algorithm by antecedent and conseguent means.                                                                                               
=> In order for selection consider support, confidence, lift, conviction.                                                                                         
=> Data Preprocessing is carried.                                                                                                  
=> Train dataset using APRIORI.                                                                                                  
=> Obtain result in DataFrame format.
